# Moar Fit

A service that tracks fitness information and makes recommendations on how to improve fitness.

## Vision

Access and upload fitness data at any time, any where and through any device. Receive recommendations where and
when they matter the most

## General Design

The goal of this work will be a "from scratch" analysis of what it means to be "fit", how to use existing technology
already available to help transition people to become "fitter"

To facilitate this goal the service will be constructed primariliy as an API, with clients implementing the API how
they wish.

Additional web apps, native apps or integrations with external devices such as gymnasium machinery can be built by
any third party.

## Cost Model

The profit model of this work is to allow users to access their data over a longer time scale, which in turn allows
recommendations about improving fitness.

Users would be able to log 50 API calls per 30 days, with unlimited API calls being allowed for $5 USD per month.
