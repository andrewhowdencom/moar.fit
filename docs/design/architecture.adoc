= Architecture

== Languages

Languages are limited to the set of people who can implement them.
Broadly, there are no language restrictions however please moderate
language choice on how many colleagues are also familiar with that
language.

* Python
* Golang

== Server architecture

Micro-service architecture. All applications should communicate only via
API. Internally, that API is driven by gRPC / Protobuf. Communication
via the outside world is by an API gateway exposes a limited set of
calls via both gRPC and application/json.

== Client Architecture

Any client side framework is fine, but for the prototype something like
Angular JS would seem appropriate.
