# Interfaces

This document is about the various interfaces that Moar Fit has with it's various consumers.

## Web

The goal of the website is to get users to sign up and start playing with the application. The application should then
do as much as possible to welcome users and integrate with their training.

## Developer

The goal of the developer website is to allow both internal and external developers to integrate with the "Moar Fit"
platform. The documentation for both is the same, designed to force internal developers to correctly express their
API designs initially.
